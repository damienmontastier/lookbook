Experimentation of a slider (lookbook with photos) developed with [**Nuxt.JS**](https://fr.nuxtjs.org/) and [**GSAP**](https://greensock.com/gsap). Inspired by a shoot on [**Dribbble**](http://dribbble.com). Dynamic components are used to generate custom divs based on the contents of the page in the data.json.
